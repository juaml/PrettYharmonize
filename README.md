# Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites

## About

The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich Machine Learning Library

It is currently being developed and maintained at the [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/applied-machine-learning-aml) group at [Forschungszentrum Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en), Germany.


## Overview

**PrettYharmonize** is a Python package developed to address data leakage in the harmonization of biomedical datasets with site-specific variability, particularly under scenarios where class balance differs across data collection sites. Traditional harmonization methods like ComBat, while widely used, often struggle with data leakage, leading to compromised model performance. PrettYharmonize introduces a novel approach that leverages "pretending" target labels to mitigate this issue, preserving biologically relevant signals without inadvertently introducing leakage. The methodology has been validated on synthetic benchmarks and real-world data, including MRI and clinical datasets, to ensure robustness in diverse site-target-dependence scenarios.
